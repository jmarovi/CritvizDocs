## Crivitz Documentation

The Crivitz Documentation website is generated using Vitepress, a static site generator built on top of Vite, a modern build tool for JavaScript applications. Vitepress allows for easy creation of documentation websites using Markdown and Vue components.

### Generating the Documentation Site

To generate the documentation site locally or for deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jmarovi/CritvizDocs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```sh
   cd CritvizDocs
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Run Vitepress:**
   ```sh
   pnpm vitepress dev docs
   ```

5. **Access the Documentation Site:**
   Once Vitepress has successfully compiled the documentation site, you can access it in your web browser at the provided address (typically http://localhost:3000).

### Contributing to Documentation

To contribute to the documentation, you can edit the Markdown files located in the `docs` directory. After making changes, commit your changes to a new branch and create a pull request for review.
