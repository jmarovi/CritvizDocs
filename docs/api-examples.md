# VitePress Notes

VitePress is a Static Site Generator (SSG) designed for building fast, content-centric websites. In a nutshell, VitePress takes your source content written in Markdown, applies a theme to it, and generates static HTML pages that can be easily deployed anywhere.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm add -D vitepress
pnpm add -D vue

pnpm vitepress init
```

## Run Project

```sh
pnpm vitepress dev docs
```

or

```sh
pnpm run docs:dev
```

## Directories

When you runÂ `vitepress dev`Â orÂ `vitepress build`Â from the command line, VitePress will use the current working directory as project root. To specify a sub-directory as root, you will need to pass the relative path to the command. For example, if your VitePress project is located inÂ `./docs`, you should runÂ `vitepress dev docs`:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€ docs                    # project root
â”‚  â”œâ”€ .vitepress           # config dir
â”‚  â”œâ”€ getting-started.md
â”‚  â””â”€ index.md
â””â”€ ...
```

TheÂ `docs`Â directory is considered theÂ **project root**Â of the VitePress site. TheÂ `.vitepress`Â directory is a reserved location for VitePress' config file, dev server cache, build output, and optional theme customization code.

The config file (`.vitepress/config.js`) allows you to customize various aspects of your VitePress site, with the most basic options being the title and description of the site.

Markdown files outside theÂ `.vitepress`Â directory are consideredÂ **source files**.

VitePress usesÂ **file-based routing**: eachÂ `.md`Â file is compiled into a correspondingÂ `.html`Â file with the same path. For example,Â `index.md`Â will be compiled intoÂ `index.html`, and can be visited at the root pathÂ `/`Â of the resulting VitePress site.

## File-Based Routing

VitePress uses file-based routing, which means the generated HTML pages are mapped from the directory structure of the source Markdown files. For example, given the following directory structure:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€ guide
â”‚  â”œâ”€ getting-started.md
â”‚  â””â”€ index.md
â”œâ”€ index.md
â””â”€ prologue.md
```

The generated HTML pages will be:

```sh
index.md                  -->  /index.html (accessible as /)
prologue.md               -->  /prologue.html
guide/index.md            -->  /guide/index.html (accessible as /guide/)
guide/getting-started.md  -->  /guide/getting-started.html
```

The resulting HTML can be hosted on any web server that can serve static files.

## Linking Between Pages

You can use both absolute and relative paths when linking between pages. Note that although bothÂ `.md`Â andÂ `.html`Â extensions will work, the best practice is to omit file extensions so that VitePress can generate the final URLs based on your config.

```md
<!-- Do -->
[Getting Started](./getting-started)
[Getting Started](../guide/getting-started)
```

### Linking to Non-VitePress Pages

If you want to link to a page in your site that is not generated by VitePress, you'll either need to use the full URL (opens in a new tab) or explicitly specify the target:

```md
[Link to pure.html](/pure.html){target="_self"}
```

## Generating Clean URL

If, however, you cannot configure your server with such support, you will have to manually resort to the following directory structure:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€ getting-started
â”‚  â””â”€ index.md
â”œâ”€ installation
â”‚  â””â”€ index.md
â””â”€ index.md
```

## Build and Test Locally

1. Run this command to build the docs:

```sh
npm run docs:build
```

2. Once built, preview it locally by running:

```sh
npm run docs:preview
```

TheÂ `preview`Â command will boot up a local static web server that will serve the output directoryÂ `.vitepress/dist`Â atÂ `http://localhost:4173`. You can use this to make sure everything looks good before pushing to production.
3. You can configure the port of the server by passingÂ `--port`Â as an argument.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:preview": "vitepress preview docs --port 8080"
  }
}
```

Now theÂ `docs:preview`Â method will launch the server atÂ `http://localhost:8080`.

### Code Highlight

it's possible to highlight directly in the line by using theÂ `// [!code highlight]`Â comment.

**Input**

```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!' // [!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```

## Focus in Code Blocks

Adding theÂ `// [!code focus]`Â comment on a line will focus it and blur the other parts of the code.

Additionally, you can define a number of lines to focus usingÂ `// [!code focus:<lines>]`.

**Input**

```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Focused!' // [!code focus]
    }
  }
}

```

```md
msg: 'Removed' // [!code --]
msg: 'Added' // [!code ++]
msg: 'Error', // [!code error]
msg: 'Warning' // [!code warning]
```

Line numbering

```ts:line-numbers {1}
// line-numbers is enabled
const line2 = 'This is line 2'
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
```

# Asset Handling

## Referencing Static Assets

All Markdown files are compiled into Vue components and processed byÂ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html). You can,Â **and should**, reference any assets using relative URLs:

```md
![An image](./image.png)
```

You can reference static assets in your markdown files, yourÂ `*.vue`Â components in the theme, styles and plainÂ `.css`Â files either using absolute public paths (based on project root) or relative paths (based on your file system). The latter is similar to the behavior you are used to if you have used Vite, Vue CLI, or webpack'sÂ `file-loader`.

Common image, media, and font filetypes are detected and included as assets automatically.

## The Public Directory[â€‹](https://vitepress.dev/guide/asset-handling#the-public-directory)

Sometimes you may need to provide static assets that are not directly referenced in any of your Markdown or theme components, or you may want to serve certain files with the original filename. Examples of such files includeÂ `robots.txt`, favicons, and PWA icons.

You can place these files in theÂ `public`Â directory under theÂ [source directory](https://vitepress.dev/guide/routing#source-directory). For example, if your project root isÂ `./docs`Â and using default source directory location, then your public directory will beÂ `./docs/public`.

Assets placed inÂ `public`Â will be copied to the root of the output directory as-is.

Note that you should reference files placed inÂ `public`Â using root absolute path - for example,Â `public/icon.png`Â should always be referenced in source code asÂ `/icon.png`.

## Usage

VitePress supports YAML frontmatter in all Markdown files, parsing them withÂ [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter). The frontmatter must be at the top of the Markdown file (before any elements includingÂ `<script>`Â tags), and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Example:

```yaml
---
title: Docs with VitePress
editLink: true
---
```

Many site or default theme config options have corresponding options in frontmatter. You can use frontmatter to override specific behavior for the current page only. For details, seeÂ [Frontmatter Config Reference](https://vitepress.dev/reference/frontmatter-config).

You can also define custom frontmatter data of your own, to be used in dynamic Vue expressions on the page.

## Accessing Frontmatter Data

Frontmatter data can be accessed via the specialÂ `$frontmatter`Â global variable:

Here's an example of how you could use it in your Markdown file:

```md
---
title: Docs with VitePress
editLink: true
---

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Guide content
```

### Interpolation

Each Markdown file is first compiled into HTML and then passed on as a Vue component to the Vite process pipeline. This means you can use Vue-style interpolation in text:

**Input**
    
```md
{{ 1 + 1 }}
```

**Output**

```md
2
```

### Directives

Directives also work (note that by design, raw HTML is also valid in Markdown):

**Input**

```html
<span v-for="i in 3">{{ i }}</span>
```

**Output**

```md
1 2 3 
```

## `<script>`Â andÂ `<style>`

Root-levelÂ `<script>`Â andÂ `<style>`Â tags in Markdown files work just like they do in Vue SFCs, includingÂ `<script setup>`,Â `<style module>`, etc. The main difference here is that there is noÂ `<template>`Â tag: all other root-level content is Markdown. Also note that all tags should be placedÂ **after**Â the frontmatter:

```html
---
hello: world
---

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

## Markdown Content

The count is: {{ count }}

<button :class="$style.button" @click="count++">Increment</button>

<style module>
.button {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```

## Using Components

You can import and use Vue components directly in Markdown files.

### Importing in Markdown

If a component is only used by a few pages, it's recommended to explicitly import them where they are used. This allows them to be properly code-split and only loaded when the relevant pages are shown:

```html
<script setup>
import CustomComponent from '../components/CustomComponent.vue'
</script>

# Docs

This is a .md using a custom component

<CustomComponent />

## More docs

...
```

## Using CSS Pre-processors

VitePress hasÂ [built-in support](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors)Â for CSS pre-processors:Â `.scss`,Â `.sass`,Â `.less`,Â `.styl`Â andÂ `.stylus`Â files. There is no need to install Vite-specific plugins for them, but the corresponding pre-processor itself must be installed:

```sh
# .scss and .sass
npm install -D sass

# .less
npm install -D less

# .styl and .stylus
npm install -D stylus
```

Then you can use the following in Markdown and theme components:

```html
<style lang="sass">
.title
  font-size: 20px
</style>
```
